# AWS S3 Setup Guide for ChatPDF

This guide will help you set up AWS S3 for cloud storage of PDF files in your ChatPDF application.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why AWS S3?

- **Scalability**: Handle unlimited PDF uploads
- **Reliability**: 99.99% availability guarantee
- **Cost-effective**: Pay only for what you use
- **Security**: Private access with signed URLs
- **Global**: Access from anywhere in the world

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

1. **AWS Account**: You need an active AWS account
2. **AWS CLI** (optional): For advanced management
3. **Node.js**: Your backend should be running

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup

### Step 1: Create S3 Bucket

1. Go to [AWS S3 Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/)
2. Click "Create bucket"
3. Enter a unique bucket name (e.g., `chatpdf-storage-123`)
4. Choose your preferred region (e.g., `us-east-1`)
5. Keep default settings for now
6. Click "Create bucket"

### Step 2: Create IAM User

1. Go to [AWS IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)
2. Click "Users" â†’ "Create user"
3. Enter username: `chatpdf-s3-user`
4. Select "Programmatic access"
5. Click "Next: Permissions"
6. Click "Attach existing policies directly"
7. Search for and select `AmazonS3FullAccess`
8. Click "Next: Tags" (optional)
9. Click "Next: Review"
10. Click "Create user"
11. **IMPORTANT**: Save the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key

### Step 3: Configure Environment

1. In your `backend/.env` file, add:
```env
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIA...
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_S3_BUCKET=your-bucket-name
```

2. Replace the values with your actual credentials

### Step 4: Run Setup Script

```bash
cd backend
npm run setup-s3
```

This script will:
- Verify your credentials
- Create the bucket if it doesn't exist
- Set up proper security policies
- Test the connection

## ðŸ”’ Security Configuration

### Bucket Policy
The setup script automatically configures a secure bucket policy that:
- Denies public access to all objects
- Only allows access through your application
- Uses signed URLs for temporary access

### CORS Configuration (if needed)
If you encounter CORS issues, add this to your S3 bucket:

```json
[
    {
        "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
        "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "PUT", "POST", "DELETE"],
        "AllowedOrigins": ["http://localhost:3000", "https://yourdomain.com"],
        "ExposeHeaders": []
    }
]
```

## ðŸ’° Cost Optimization

### S3 Storage Classes
- **Standard**: For frequently accessed files
- **Standard-IA**: For infrequently accessed files (cheaper)
- **Glacier**: For long-term storage (very cheap)

### Lifecycle Policies
Set up automatic transitions to cheaper storage classes:

1. Go to S3 bucket â†’ Management â†’ Lifecycle
2. Create rule for "Move current versions of objects between storage classes"
3. Transition to Standard-IA after 30 days
4. Transition to Glacier after 90 days

### Cost Monitoring
- Set up AWS Budgets to monitor spending
- Enable S3 Storage Lens for detailed analytics
- Set up CloudWatch alarms for unusual usage

## ðŸ§ª Testing Your Setup

### 1. Test Upload
```bash
# Start your backend
npm run dev

# Upload a PDF through your frontend
# Check the S3 console to see the file
```

### 2. Test Download
```bash
# The PDF processor should automatically download from S3
# Check your backend logs for S3 operations
```

### 3. Test Deletion
```bash
# Delete a PDF through your frontend
# Verify it's removed from S3
```

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Access Denied" Error
- Check IAM user permissions
- Verify bucket policy
- Ensure credentials are correct

#### 2. "Bucket Not Found" Error
- Verify bucket name spelling
- Check AWS region
- Ensure bucket exists

#### 3. "Invalid Access Key" Error
- Regenerate access keys
- Check environment variables
- Restart your application

#### 4. CORS Errors
- Add CORS configuration to S3 bucket
- Check allowed origins
- Verify request headers

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check environment variables
echo $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
echo $AWS_S3_BUCKET

# Test S3 connection
aws s3 ls s3://your-bucket-name

# Check bucket policy
aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket your-bucket-name
```

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring & Maintenance

### CloudWatch Metrics
- Monitor S3 requests and errors
- Set up alerts for high usage
- Track storage costs

### S3 Analytics
- Enable storage class analysis
- Monitor access patterns
- Optimize storage costs

### Regular Maintenance
- Review access logs monthly
- Clean up unused objects
- Update IAM policies as needed

## ðŸš€ Production Considerations

### Multi-Region Setup
- Use S3 Cross-Region Replication
- Choose regions close to your users
- Consider compliance requirements

### Backup Strategy
- Enable versioning for critical files
- Set up cross-region replication
- Regular backup testing

### Performance Optimization
- Use CloudFront CDN for global access
- Implement proper caching headers
- Monitor and optimize request patterns
